# Spotify Website & Script Collection

This project, as of 11/15/19, contains several Python scripts that access the Spotify API to look at user data and allow people to see their data. 

## Getting Started

To use, select and download the desired files.

**topartists.py** allows users to see their top artists or tracks, as well as the popularity of said tracks.

**spotpitest.py** allows users to view specific artists' tracks, those tracks' album arts, and starts playback on devices at the same time.

**search_audio_features.py** allows users to search for music, with several filters available, and returns the results' audio features.

## Running the scripts

You can run the scripts as you would any Python script, e.g. `python topartists.py [user ID]`. If you don't include your user ID, then you will be prompted after simply entering `python topartists.py`. As of now, there is no authentication using your own username, but I hope to implement that soon.
